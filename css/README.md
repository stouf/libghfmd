CSS
===


In this folder, there're elements that can help you building your own CSS file.

You can find the following files:

- **test.md**, which is a markdown formated text file wrapping some JavaScript
    code
- **test.html**, which is the file resulting from the GitHub API for markdown
    rendering.   
    This file is the one that needs a css file, according to the classes defined
- **test_indented.html**, which simple **test.html**, intended, in order to make
    it easy to read.   
    This file is NOT the one that should be viewed in a browser and any other
    HTML rendering stuff, it only aims to help reading the original
    **test.html** file.
